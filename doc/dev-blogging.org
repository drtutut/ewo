#+TITLE: Development of blogging categories.

* General presentation


  A dynamic category consists of a folder (like a static category).
  
  A dynamic category contains an index.org file. Only the first
  section of this file is freely editable. Next sections are generated
  by the EWO system.

  Other org files in the category are articles. They are freely
  editable.

  These files can contain a section with property HEADNOTE. 

  The `ewo-blog-publish' function invoked in a buffer containing a
  file other than index.org in a dynamic category:

  - adds a dated header entry in the index.org file
  - adds a excerpt of the begining of the file to the generated
    section in index.org.
