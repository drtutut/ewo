#+TITLE: EWO (Easy Website with Org)
#+AUTHOR: Eric WÃ¼rbel

* Introduction

  This is EWO 3.4

  EWO is an extension to the orgmode HTML publishing mechanism. It allows
  to define a simple static web site based on /categories/. 

  Namely, a category is a directory in the web site tree, associated
  with an entry in the navigation bar. This allows the automatic
  generation of a navigation bar.

  EWO heavily relies on the [[http://getbootstrap.com/][boostrap]] framework. For now it uses the
  3.3.7 version of bootstrap.

  Besides, EWO brings some tools to easily use some functionnalities
  of the bootstrap framework.

  EWO started as a personnal project : allows the generation of my
  professionnal web pages from orgmode documents. 

  Release 2.0 is a partial rewrite of the original project, to define
  EWO as a derived back-end of the org html back-end.

  Release 3.0 introduces blogging categories.

  Release 3.1 introduces a tagging system to classify blog articles.

  Release 3.2 introduces a very crude templating mechanism. It also
  corrects some bugs.

  Release 3.3 introduces non new functionnality, but the preparation
  functions for the blogging categories went under a major
  rewrite. The result is a general speedup of the publishing process.

  Release 3.4 introduces a new algorithm to compute the text excerpts
  displayend in the index pages of blogging categories.

* WARNING

  Starting with release 3.2, we come back to a single root directory
  for the sources of a site. It is defined in the ~ewo-root-dir~
  variable. Thus, if a site configuration is defined for a former
  release of ewo, check it !

* Installation
** Dependencies / Incompatibilities

   Ewo needs the following emacs packages :
   - avl-tree
   - uuidgen
   - cl-lib

     
   Do not try to replace bootstrap 3.x with bootstrap 4.x : it wont
   work, as EWO relies on the ~panel~ divs which disappeared from 4.x.

   Support for both bootstrap 3.x and 4.x is planned. 

** Installing

  Add the directory of ewo lisp files to the =load-path= variable. For
  example :

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/local/emacs-lisp/ewo-3.0beta")
  #+END_SRC
  
  Org mode should be loaded :

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'org)
  #+END_SRC

  To load EWO, add :
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'ox-ewo)
  #+END_SRC

  If you want to assign a key combination to the ewo publishing
  function, add it in the org mode map. For example :
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-=") 'ewo-publish)
  #+END_SRC

  Same remark for the new article function :
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-+") 'ewo-new-article)
  #+END_SRC

  Customize the variable =org-export-backends= and add the =ewo=
  backend to it.

  Note that EWO relies on the following emacs packages, all available
  via elpa :
  - cl-lib
  - uuidgen
  - avl-tree

  You should be done. Go to the following section to start a new website.

* Starting a fresh project

  1. Copy the content of the =www= directory in ewo to the root of your project.
  2. Define the variables of your project, as described in the section
     [[#DefEWOProject][Defining an EWO project]].
  3. The root of your website, and the root of each category *must*
     contain an =index.org= file.

* Defining an EWO project
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: DefEWOProject
  :END:

  Unlike the org HTML publishing mechanism, in order to define an EWO
  project, you do not need to configure the
  =org-publish-project-alist= variable. EWO will generate
  automatically this alist based on your definition of the categories.

  We now present the different variables which are used to define an
  EWO project.

** variable =ewo-name=

   This variable contains a string which defines the name of your website. 

   The definition of this variable is not mandatory.

   Default: ~"EWO"~

** variable ~ewo-root-dir~ 

   Root directory of the org-source of the website. That is, the full
   path of the directory containing the org files containing the pages
   of your future site, along with the auxiliary files like css
   stylesheets, javascript files, images\dots

   The definition of this variable is mandatory.

** variable =ewo-configurations=

   Association list of alternative publishing configurations for
   ewo. The CAR of each element of the alist is a string, uniquely
   identifying the configuration. the CDR of each element is a well
   formed property list with an event number of elements, alternating
   keys and values, which specifies the configuration values. The
   possible configuration values are:

   - ~:publish-dir~ :: The publishing directory of the website. This
                       variable contains the full path where your
                       project will be exported in its html form. It
                       can be a path on the local machine,but also a
                       tramp-like pathname defining a path on a remote
                       machine[fn:1].
                        
                       
   This allows for multiple publishing configurations (for example you
   can have a test configuration and a production configuration.

   When the function ~ewo-publish~ is invoked interactively, it asks
   for the identifier of the configuration. By default, it uses the
   first item of this alist.

   It is mandatory that you define at least one entry in this alist.

[fn:1] This feature has not been tested, please let me know if it works. 

** variable =ewo-categories=

   This variable contains an alist describing the categories of your website.
   each entry of the alist contain :

   - the category id :: this is a string which acts as a category selector.
   - =:label= property :: this is a string defining the label of the
        category as it appears in the navigation bar.
   - =:directory= property :: this is a string defining the
        subdirectory containing the pages of the category.
   - =:icon= property :: this is an optionnal property giving the name
        of an icon as it is named in the glyphicon system of the
        bootstrap framework (see example below)
   - =:type= ::  this is a category type which can be :
     + =static= :: a static category, that is, a freely organizable
                   subtree of org documents, each one generating a
                   HTML page. The only mandatory file is =index.org=
                   which must be present in the category
                   directory. [[#dcad7a4d-c1a9-4ad3-872e-864b247317f2][More on static categories]]
     + =blog= :: a blogging category. The file =index.org= is
                 mandatory in the directory tree. The user can freely
                 edit this file, but it has to contain a section
                 heading with a =HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= multivalued
                 property containing the ~ewo-toc~ class. It will
                 contain the table of content of the category
                 (automatically generated). Other org files in the
                 subtree are articles, which will be published under
                 certain conditions. [[#d4d360f0-db39-4814-9f70-b3097834153c][More on blogging categories]]

                 
   You must define at least one category.

** variable =ewo-home-name=

   The name of the homepage. Default is ~"Home"~.

** variable =ewo-doc-extensions=
   
   A regular expression defining the allowed extensions for the
   additionnal documents of your site, which are stored in the
   =documents= directory (see section [[#SiteStructure][Site Structure]]).

   Default is ~pdf\\|doc\\|odt\\|ods\\|odp\\|odg\\|tar.gz\\|tgz\\|tar.bz2\\|zip~

** variable =ewo-img-extensions=

   A regular expression defining the allowed extensions for the
   additionnal images of your site, which are stored in the
   =images= directory (see section [[#SiteStructure][Site Structure]]).

   Default is ~"jpg\\|gif\\|png\\|svg"~

** variable =ewo-html-preamble=

   A string containing HTML code to be included in the preamble of a page.

** variable =ewo-html-postamble=

   part.

** variable =ewo-html-head=

   A string containing the /head of the home page and of any page
   generated at the root of the site/. This code will be included in
   the <head></head> section. Be careful if you tweak this variable,
   because it contains the inclusion of different CSS stylesheet
   (bootstrap in particular, but also jquery).

** variable =ewo-cat-html-head=

   A string containing the head of the pages contained in a category.
   This code will be included in the <head></head> section. Be careful
   if you tweak this variable, because it contains the inclusion of
   different CSS stylesheet (bootstrap in particular, but also
   jquery). it also uses the ~<lisp></lisp>~ mechanism to universalize
   links to files. See documentation of the [[#5b64f846-e6bb-4b14-8aef-404220426e02][~<lisp></lisp>~ mechanism]]
   for more details.

    glyphicon =glyphicon-eye-open= as an icon.
  - a blog category : it will be labelled "News" and will be rooted in
    =~/Documents/www/MySite/org/News=. It will use the glyphicon
    =glyphicon-pencil=.

* Site structure 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: SiteStructure
  :END:

  Every EWO project has a structure similar to the following :

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  root-directory +-- Category1
                 |
		 |   ...
		 |
                 +-- CategoryN

		 |
		 +-- images
                 |
                 +-- tags
		 |
		 \-- documents
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The minimal content of these directory is defined hereafter. Note
  that the mandatory files are provided by ewo. The =tags= directory
  is not necessarily created, and is relatied to the tags system. See
  [[*Tags][tags]] for details.

** the =css= directory

   Should contain at least the following files (provided that you did
   not customize the =ewo-html-head= and the =ewo-cat-html-head=, see
   below) :
   - =mytypo.css= :: Typographic definitions. Typically font definitions.
   - =bootstrap.min.css= :: Bootstrap css definitions.
   - =mystyle.css= ::  your personnal css definitions goes here.

** the =js= directory

   Should contain at least the following files (provided that you did
   not customize the =ewo-html-head= and the =ewo-cat-html-head=, see
   below) :
   - =html5shiv.min.js= :: javascript needed by bootstrap (for IE8) 
   - =respond.min.js= :: javascript needed by bootstrap (for IE8) 

** the =fonts= directory

   Should contain the glyphicons font for bootstrap.

** the =images= directory

   There are no requirements in this directory. You should put your images here.

** the =documents= directory

   There are no requirements in this directory. You should put the
   documents linked to the pages of your site here.

** Example

   Going back to [[#6fefa485-7152-4af4-b761-3f19ee2ee44f][this example]], the structure of the site is :
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ~/Documents/www/MySite/org +-- Teaching

* Static categories
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: dcad7a4d-c1a9-4ad3-872e-864b247317f2
  :END:
  
  In a static category, the only mandatory file is =index.org=.  The
  remaining files are totally under your responsability. All the
  remaining files should be org files. Only org files will be
  published. SThis means that, if your pages need extra files, like
  images or additionnal documents, these files must be present in the
  subtrees rooted in =documents= and =images= directories.

  Providing the navigation links from =index.org= to other org files
  in the category is under your responsability.

* Blogging categories
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
  
  In a blogging category, the only mandatory file is =index.org=. Its
  content is free, but it should contain a headline with property
  ~HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS~. This property must contain at least a value
  ~ewo-toc~, indicating that the table of content of this category
  will be generated under this headline. All other org files are articles.

** Articles
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: 1c6e6e19-535d-44f2-944a-2606affada4d
   :END:

   Any org file in a blogging category, appart from =index.org=, is an
   article.  Articles must have a ~TITLE~ keyword and a ~DATE~
   keyword. The ~DATE~ must be an org timestamp. 

   An article should have an ~EWO_STATE~ keyword. This keyword accept
   two values : ~published~ and ~unpublished~. A ~published~ article
   will be included in the [[#3e75920b-7458-40a8-8050-2add6f4d959f][table of content of the category]], and in
   the [[#3ab41567-c4b8-41b1-b621-ab50c1a76d8d][last articles list]] of the global =index.org= file of the site,
   if this feature is requested. If the value of ~EWO_STATE~ is
   different from published, or if the ~EWO_STATE~ keyword is not
   present, the article will not appear in the table of content, nor
   in the las articles list. Note that in all cases, /the html page
   corresponding to this org file will be generated/. If you do not
   want the content of this article to be published use the ~COMMENT~
   or ~noexport~ feature from org.

   The body of articles can contain a block =ewo_head=, representing
   the head material (headlines) of the article. If it is present:
   - It will generate a ~<div class="ewo_head">~, which can then be customized
     in the =mystyle.css= file.
   - the generation process of the table of content and last article
     list will extract the begining of this block. This excerpt will
     be included in the table of content of the category and in the
     global list of last articles. The length of this excerpt can be
     customized with the [[#5fbac1b0-957c-4a6c-998b-136265f83ec6][=ewo-excerpt-size=]] variable.

     
   During the table of content generation process, EWO will add a
   ~EWO_ARTICLE_ID~ to each article, with a UUID as value.

** Table of content of a blogging category
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: 3e75920b-7458-40a8-8050-2add6f4d959f
   :END:

   A table of content (toc) of all articles in a blogging category is
   automatically generated by EWO in the =index.org= file present at
   the root of the category.

   The toc is generated under a headline having the property
   ~HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS~ containing a value ~ewo-toc~. Note that it
   means that the enclosing ~<div>~ of the toc has the class
   ~ewo-toc~, which allows you to customize the appearence of elements
   present it.

   If there is no headline containing the ~HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS~
   property with the expected value, EWO will create one, and will
   name it "Published so far". It will have a level of 1. If there is
   no =index.org= in the category, ir will create a minimal one (with
   a ~TITLE~, a ~DATE~, and a toc headline).

   If the toc headline is at level ~n~, then the entries in the toc
   will be at level ~n+1~.

   Each [[#1c6e6e19-535d-44f2-944a-2606affada4d][published article]] has an associated entry in the toc.

   Each entry headline is formated using the [[#ba2eeced-28a9-4696-ac8b-8e4f56e76762][=ewo_blog-toc-entry-format=]]. 

   The body of each entry consists in an excerpt of the ~ewo_head~
   block in the article if it exists. The size of the excerpt can be
   customized with the variable [[#5fbac1b0-957c-4a6c-998b-136265f83ec6][=ewo-excerpt-size=]].

   The toc is sorted in reverse chronological order. The date used is
   the date present in the ~DATE~ keyword of articles.

   :CUSTOM_ID: 3ab41567-c4b8-41b1-b621-ab50c1a76d8d
   :END:

   A list of last published articles can be generated in the
   =index.org= file of the website. To request this generation, add a
   headline in =index.org= with the property ~HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS~
   property containing the value ~ewo-toc~. Note that this means that
   the enclosing ~<div>~ of the toc has the class ~ewo-toc~, which
   allows you to customize the appearence of elements present it.

   All ublished blog articles in all blogging categories are
   considered for this list. This does not mean that all these
   articles will be present in the list, see below.

   If there is no headline containing the ~HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS~
   property with the expected value, EWO will not generate it.

   If the toc headline is at level ~n~, then the entries in the toc
   will be at level ~n+1~.

   :CUSTOM_ID:c1d29f01-0038-493a-98dd-2ab9bbb4ccc1
   :END:

   The tag system allows to classify thematically blog articles, that
   is, articles which are [[#1c6e6e19-535d-44f2-944a-2606affada4d][published]].

   You can associate a list of tags to an article using the [[info:org#Tag%20inheritance][FILETAGS]]
   option of org mode.

   During the publication of the site, tags will be collected and :
   - a global tags.org file will be generated in the root directory,
     containing a listing all collected tags and how many blog
     articles mention it.
   - For each tag ~tagname~ a file ~tags/tagname.org~ will be
     generated, containing links to the articles mentionning this tag.
   - a "Tags" menu entry is generated. This entry appears ob the home
     page and in blogging categories. If no tags have bee collected,
     then no menu entry is generated.

* Deeper customization
** the ~<lisp></lisp>~ mechanism
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: 5b64f846-e6bb-4b14-8aef-404220426e02
   :END:

   EWO enables the insertion of ~<lisp></lisp>~ constructs in your pages.

   These constructs allows you to call lisp functions to produce a
   textual result which is then substituted to the <lisp></lisp>
   construct. Actually, you cannot execute any lisp expression,
   because it would be a *monstruous* security hole. The lisp
   expression should be :
   - a functionn call. Each argument should be in turn an authorized
     expression.
   - a variable
   - a constant
   Moreover, the function and the variables must be members of
   /authorization lists/ :

   - =ewo-template-funcs= :: List of authorized functions for =<lisp>=
        constructs. Initially contains 
     + the =ewo-rootlink= function, which generates an up link to root
       of the site depending on LEVEL parameter.
     + the =ewo-filetags= function, which generates a list of the tags
       used in a blog article. It has a mandatory CATNAME argument
       which is the category name, and an optionnal SEP argument which
       is a string used as a separator between the tags (a space by
       default). The function generates a list of tags appearing in a
       blog article, and links them to the corresponding tag page (see
       documentation of the [[*Tags][tag system]]).
     + arithmetic functions : ~+~, ~-~, ~*~, ~/~, ~%~, ~mod~,
     + ~1+~ and ~1-~ incrementing and decrementing operators.
     + ~quote~ function.
   - =ewo-template-vars= :: List of authorized variables for ~<lisp>~
        constructs. Initially contains :
     + the variable ~ewo:catlevel~, which contains the category level
       in the context of the call. Note that this is NOT a a global
       variable. 
     + the variable ~ewo:catname~, which contains the category name in
       the context of the call.

   The binding of variables is local to the ~<lisp>~ construct
   machinery to keep it safe.

   In order to put ~<lisp>~ constructs in your org pages, you must
   enclose them in HTML blocks like
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
     <lisp>(ewo-rootlink ewo:catlevel)</lisp>
     ,#+END_EXPORT
   #+END_SRC

   or 
 
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+HTML: <lisp>(ewo-rootlink ewo:catlevel)</lisp>
   #+END_SRC

   or using inline inclusion like ~@@html:<lisp>(ewo-rootlink
   ewo:catlevel)</lisp>@@~.

   You can also use these constructs in the ewo configuration
   variables which accept HTML : ~ewo-html-postample~,
   ~ewo-html-preamble~, ~ewo-html-head~, ~ewo-cat-html-head~.

   For now there is no clear documentation on how to extend this
   mechanism (adding functions or args). If you whish to add you own
   functions and variables, please check the ~ewo-filter-prepost~
   function which implements the internal machinery of ~<lisp></lisp>~
   constructs.

** the ~<ewo-static></ewo-static>~ elements 

   Allows to insert HTML code only in pages of static categories. Very
   useful combined to the ~<lisp>~ mechanism. For example :

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
     <ewo-static><lisp>ewo:catname</lisp></ewo-static>
     ,#+END_EXPORT
   #+END_SRC

   Note that, in this example, the lisp code will never be evaluated
   in a blog article, as the ~<ewo-static>~ block will be removed.

** the ~<ewo-blog></ewo-blog>~ elements 

   Allows to insert HTML code only in pages of blog categories. Very
   useful combined to the ~<lisp>~ mechanism. For example :

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
     <ewo-blog><lisp>(ewo-filetags ewo:catname ", ")</lisp></ewo-blog>
     ,#+END_EXPORT
   #+END_SRC

   Note that, in this example, the lisp code will never be evaluated
   in a static page, as the ~<ewo-blog>~ block will be removed.

** Bootstrap panels

   There are two ways to create bootstrap panels with EWO. You can
   either include any text within a section into a panel, or turn an
   entire section (and its subsections) into a bootstrap panel.

*** Creating a panel within a section

    It suffices to enclose the paragraphs which you want to include in
    the panel in proper HTML entities using the special blocks
    mechanism. For instance:

    #+BEGIN_SRC org
      ,#+ATTR_HTML: :class panel-warning
      ,#+BEGIN_panel
      ,#+BEGIN_panel-heading
      Question
      ,#+END_panel-heading
      ,#+BEGIN_panel-body
      OÃ¹ se trouve le fichier correspondant Ã  la page qui est ouverte ?
      ,#+END_panel-body
      ,#+END_panel
    #+END_SRC

    This will create a warning panel, i.e. a =<div>= of class =panel
    panel-warning=.

*** Turning a subtree into a panel
    :PROPERTIES:
    :END:

    For this, just add a =HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= property to the
    enclosing section of the subtree, as in :

    #+BEGIN_SRC org
      ,* Mise en garde, mÃ©thode !
        :PROPERTIES:
        :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: panel panel-danger
        :END:

        Au cours des TP, vous allez Ãªtre amenÃ©s Ã  modifier les fichiers de
        configuration existants d'Apache. Une erreur dans une ligne peut
        engendrer un dysfonctionnement du serveur. Pour Ã©viter tout
        problÃ¨me, *faites systÃ©matiquement une copie de toute ligne modifiÃ©e
        et mettez cette copie en commentaire.* En procÃ©dant de cette faÃ§on
        il est aisÃ© de revenir dans l'Ã©tat initial. Parfois, une copie de la
        section modifiÃ©e est encore plus sÃ»r.
    #+END_SRC

** Bootstrap rows and columns
   :PROPERTIES:
   :END:

   One of the strengths of bootsrap is its grid system which allows
   the creation of responsive pages. 

   Rows and columns can be created with EWO on a section basis, that
   is, one can encapsulate successive sections in a row, specifying
   the spanning of each section.  For this, three properties are
   used :

   - =BOOTSTRAP_COLUMN= :: Used to specify the column class of a
        section e.g. =col-md-4=.
   - =BOOTSTRAP_ROW_BEGIN= :: Used to identify the section which
        begins the row. The value doesn't care.
   - =BOOTSTRAP_ROW_END= :: Used to  identify the section which
        ends the row. The value doesn't care.


   Example :

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,** Cours
        :PROPERTIES:
        :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: panel panel-primary
        :BOOTSTRAP_COLUMN: col-md-4
        :BOOTSTRAP_ROW_BEGIN: t
        :END:

     Cours 1.

     ,** TD
        :PROPERTIES:
        :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: panel panel-primary
        :BOOTSTRAP_COLUMN: col-md-4
        :END:

     blahblah.

     ,** TP
        :PROPERTIES:
        :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: panel panel-primary
        :BOOTSTRAP_COLUMN: col-md-4
        :BOOTSTRAP_ROW_END: t
        :END:

     blahblah.

   #+END_SRC

** Table of contents of pages/articles

   Ewo is able to generate a table of contents for any page as a
   dropdown menu in the navigation bar. It bases the generation on the
   ~toc:~ and ~num:~ options of the org document.

* Publishing the site

  To publish a site, invoke the ~ewo-publish~ function. This function
  asks for a configuration id (see ~ewo-configurations~) doc.

* Templating

  You can define a directory which will contain /templates/ using the
  custom variable ~ewo-template-dir~. Actually, a template is
  essentially a boilerplate org file containing the skeleton of the
  body of an article.

  These templates are used by the interactive function
  ~ewo-new-article~ whose aim is to create a new blog article
  buffer. This function creates all the necessary headers (~#+TITLE:~,
  etc.) and then insert the choosen template.
