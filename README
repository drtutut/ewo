This is EWO 3.0

EWO is an extension to the orgmode HTML publishing mechanism. It allows
to define a simple static web site based on /categories/. 

Namely, a category is a directory in the web site tree, associated
with an entry in the navigation bar. This allows the automatic
generation of a navigation bar.

Categories are of two kinds : static categories let the user organise
its pages freely, blog categories allows automatic generation of table
of content. See the manual for details.

EWO relies on the bootstrap framework.

Besides, EWO brings some tools to easily use some functionnalities
of the bootstrap framework.

EWO started as a personnal project : allows the generation of my
professionnal web pages from orgmode documents. 

Version 2.0 is a partial rewrite of the original project, to define
EWO as a derived back-end of the org html back-end.

For installation and usage instructions see the documentation in the
doc/ folder.
