This is EWO 2.0.

EWO is an extension to the orgmode HTML publishing mechanism. It allows
to define a simple static web site based on /categories/. 

Namely, a category is a directory in the web site tree, associated
with an entry in the navigation bar. This allows the automatic
generation of a navigation bar.

EWO relies on the bootstrap framework.

Besides, EWO brings some tools to easily use some functionnalities
of the bootstrap framework.

EWO started as a personnal project : allows the generation of my
professionnal web pages from orgmode documents. 

Version 2.0 is a partial rewrite of the original project, to define
EWO as a derived back-end of the org html back-end.

For installation and usage instructions see the documentation in the
doc/ folder.
